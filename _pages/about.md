We are a team of 5 QMUL students, all studying Aerospace Engineering. We are Currently working on our 3rd year dissertation project on the Mitigation of the physiological effects of long term space habitation on the human body through the development of a rotating space station to simulate Artificial Gravity. Through this we will build experience in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) using MATLAB/SIMULINK, Attitude and orbital dynamics with python, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and structural design using Abaqus and SOLIDWORKS, And DRAMA (Debris Risk Assessment and Mitigation Analysis) for end of life analysis.
